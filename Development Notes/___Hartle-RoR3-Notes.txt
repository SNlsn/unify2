Hartle RoR3 tutorial notes

Install Git

Install Ruby (requires XCode or GCC build tools)
  Install RVM: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/
  Install Ruby (note - substitute your choice of version, line two)
    $ rvm get head && rvm reload
    $ rvm install 1.9.3
    <wait a while>

Create an RVM gemset for your environment (first part is version of Ruby, second part is an identifier):
  $ rvm use 1.9.3@rails3tutorial2ndEd --create --default
  or
  $ rvm ruby-1.9.3-p125@rails32 --create --default
  or (in the case of Unify2)
  $ rvm ruby-1.9.3-p125@unify2 --create --default

Install RubyGems if it doesn't already exist
If it does, update to the current version (modify following to current RubyGem version):
  $ gem update --system 1.8.17
  
To suppress default behavior of installing boatloads of documentation (which you will probably refer to online anyway or instead), create a Gem config file:
  $ mate ~/.gemrc
In this file, add this instruction:
  gem: --no-ri --no-rdoc

Install Rails (substitute current version):
  $ gem install rails -v 3.2.1

Create a new directory (optional, just for tidiness), CD to that directory, and create a new Rails application:
  $ mkdir rails_projects
  $ cd rails_projects
  $ rails new first_app

Use Bundler to install and include the gems needed by the app:
  $ cd first_app/
  $ mate Gemfile

Hartle prefers to explicity state version numbers (understandable, since he wants his toturial to work for a long time). I consider this option for my project but, for the record, this is Hartle's Gemfile example. Do note his use of "groups" for development and assets.
Note also his use of ">=" (always performs upgrades) and "~>" (only performs upgrades to minor point releases).

  source 'https://rubygems.org'
  gem 'rails', '3.2.1'
  
  group :development do
    gem 'sqlite3', '1.3.5'
  end

  # Gems used only for assets and not required
  # in production environments by default.
  group :assets do
    gem 'sass-rails',   '3.2.3'
    gem 'coffee-rails', '3.2.2'

    gem 'uglifier', '1.2.3'
  end

  gem 'jquery-rails', '2.0.0'

Install gems:
  $ bundle install
  (shortchut that does the same thing is just plain "bundle")

Configure Git (if you haven't already):
  $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  $ git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
  $ git config --global core.editor "mate -w"

Initialize your Git repository for this project.
First, navigate to root of project. Then:
  $ git init

Modify the .gitignore file created by Rails. Note: this is a starting point. Feel free to instruct Git to ignore more if you want:
  # Ignore bundler config
  /.bundle

  # Ignore the default SQLite database.
  /db/*.sqlite3

  # Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
  /log/*.log
  /tmp

  # Ignore other unneeded files.
  doc/
  *.swp
  *~
  .project
  .DS_Store

Add everything up to this point for the initial commit:
  $ git add .

Initial commit (including message):
  $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

GitHub
  Create account if you haven't already
  Create a new project in the Git web interface to your account by clicking "create a repository" (using "first_app" in this example)
  After submitting the form, push your app (even at this early stage):
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/first_app.git
    $ git push origin master

CREATE A BRANCH BEFORE YOU SCREW WITH ANYTHING! (The name of the branch in the example below, "modify-README" is an example of a good practice: name you branch in such a way as to be descriptive of what you are working on in this branch):
  $ git checkout -b modify-README

If you want to rename a file, use
  git mv oldname.txt newname.md
so that Git will recognize this as a modified file, not a new file
Make edits. Commit the edits. You could use "git add .", but Git provides the -a flag as a shortcut for the (very common) case of committing all *modifications to existing files* (or files created using git mv, which don’t count as new files to Git - see previous note):
  $ git commit -a -m "Improve the README file"
Be careful about using the -a flag improperly; if you have added any *new files* to the project since the last commit, you still have to tell Git about them using "git add" first.

Merge branch with master:
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge modify-README

Delete branch (optional - you might instead opt to keep them around for reference):
  $ git branch -d modify-README

Push to GitHub:
  $ git push
If that throws an error, try:
  git push origin master

Heroku stuff follows, but I don't intend to publish Unify2 to Heroku, so I'm omitting those instructions.

========================
Chapter 2
========================

Generate using Scaffold (demo app is a microblogging app with Users and Microposts)

$ rails generate scaffold User name:string email:string
(note model is singular, capitalized)
create migration
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate

Foreign key for a "belongs_to" association is lowercase singular
$ rails generate scaffold Micropost content:string user_id:integer
User has_many :microposts
Micropost belongs_to :user

========================
Chapter 3
========================

create app, suppressing the test modules
$ rails new sample_app -T
(-T flag suppresses automatically creating test modules)
edit gemfile
run bundle command
install RSpec:
rails generate rspec:install
initialize Git repository and make first commit:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit."

Create Github repository and push:
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/sample_app.git
git push origin master

generate a controller for serving static pages:
rails generate controller StaticPages home help --no-test-framework
