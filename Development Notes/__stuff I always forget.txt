Stuff I always forget

* ALWAYS CREATE A NEW BRANCH when beginning a new section
* be sure to add Attributes Accessible to all models
* add index to searchable Model attributes
* prefix rake commands with "bundle exec"
  for example:
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rails server
    bundle exec rspec spec/requests/static_pages_spec.rb
    bundle exec irb (require gem, incl. version, declared in Gemfile)

Git:
    add new and changed files:
  git add .
    add only changed existing files:
  git add -a
  git status
  git commit -m "notes regarding commit"
    discard all changes and revert to the state things were in at the last commit using checkout
  git checkout -f
    create and switch to a new branch
  git checkout -b new-branch-name
    list all branches & indicate active one
  git branch
    remove a file within Git scope
  git rm public/removed-file.html
    merge a branch into Master
  git checkout master
  git merge new-branch-name
    destroy a totally botched branch
  git checkout master
  git branch -D botched-branch
    push to GitHub
  git push
    or, if that doesn't work
  git push origin master

Console
  bundle exec rails console
  quit console session by typing "exit" (or shortcut: control-d)
